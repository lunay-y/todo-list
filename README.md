For Christmas I decided to gift myself a little homemade ToDo App.

## ❔ Why this project

I wanted to create something that I would use on a day-to-day basis and that I made myself.

I also really like nature so for this project I applied a nature theme for the background.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

**Client:** HTML5, CSS3, Javascript

## 💿 App Installation

-  Make a project directory
-  Clone this repository
-  Initialise the project by opening the index.html file in the browser

## 🧐 What I have learnt from this project

I developed a better understanding of DOM manipulation and fetching APIs.

The background image changes at each page reload and it fetches nature themed images from Unsplash, considering how confused I was about DOM manipulation with this project I realised the power it provides.

Also I learnt about localstorage, very useful to store some lightweight data.
I also had some practice with importing icons and CSS3 animation, really eye-opening how powerful CSS3 is!

In the project-plan folder together with the low-fidelity wireframe of the current MVP, I have also included what the future of this app will look like.
